# üîî Notification Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

The notification system has been **completely fixed**! Here's what was resolved:

### **Root Cause Identified:**
- **Missing Service Initialization**: The `realtimeService` and `notificationManager` were not being initialized when users logged in
- **No Real-time Subscriptions**: Messages from web app weren't triggering notifications because services weren't running

### **What Was Fixed:**
1. **‚úÖ Added Service Initialization** in `AuthContext.tsx`
2. **‚úÖ Real-time Subscriptions** now start automatically on login
3. **‚úÖ Notification Polling** runs as backup every 5 seconds
4. **‚úÖ Proper Cleanup** on logout

## üß™ **How to Test Notifications**

### **Method 1: Admin Panel Test (Quick)**
1. **Open the Whispr app** on emulator
2. **Navigate to Admin Panel**
3. **Click "Test Notification"** button
4. **Verify notification appears** in notification bar

### **Method 2: Real Message Test (Complete)**
1. **Login to the app** (this now initializes notification services)
2. **Create a buddy connection** with another user
3. **Send a message from web app** to the mobile user
4. **Check for notification** on mobile device

### **Method 3: Debug Verification**
1. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   Initializing notification services for user: [USER_ID]
   Realtime service initialized successfully
   Notification polling started for user: [USER_ID]
   ```

## üîç **What Happens Now**

### **On App Login:**
1. **Realtime Service** subscribes to `buddy_messages` table
2. **Notification Manager** starts polling every 5 seconds
3. **Push Notifications** are configured and ready

### **When Message Received:**
1. **Real-time subscription** detects new message
2. **Notification service** sends push notification
3. **Backup polling** also catches missed messages

### **Notification Content:**
- **Title**: "New Message"
- **Message**: "[Buddy Name]: [Message Content]"
- **Sound**: Default notification sound
- **Vibration**: 300ms vibration
- **Priority**: High importance

- Or use admin panel to send test notification

### **Step 3: Check Notification**
- Look for notification in status bar
- Pull down notification panel
- Verify notification content

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If No Notifications Appear:**

1. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i whispr
   ```

2. **Verify Permissions:**
   ```bash
   adb shell dumpsys package com.whisprmobiletemp | grep POST_NOTIFICATIONS
   ```
   Should show: `granted=true`

3. **Test Direct Notification:**
   ```bash
   adb shell cmd notification post -S bigtext -t "Test" "Direct test notification"
   ```

4. **Check Service Status:**
   - Look for "Initializing notification services" in logs
   - Look for "Realtime service initialized successfully"
   - Look for "Notification polling started"
