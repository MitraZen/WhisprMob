# 🎯 Simple App Icon Replacement

## What You Need
- Your Whispr logo image (the one you attached)
- Any image editor (even Paint will work)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
1. Open your Whispr logo image
2. Make sure it's square (if not, crop it to be square)
3. Save it as a PNG file

### Step 2: Create Different Sizes
You need to create 5 different sizes of your image:

| Size | Where to Use |
|------|-------------|
| 48x48 pixels | For older/smaller phones |
| 72x72 pixels | For medium phones |
| 96x96 pixels | For high-resolution phones |
| 144x144 pixels | For very high-resolution phones |
| 192x192 pixels | For newest phones |

**How to resize:**
- Open your image in Paint (or any image editor)
- Go to Resize → Pixels
- Change both width and height to the size you need
- Save with a clear name like "whispr_48.png", "whispr_72.png", etc.

### Step 3: Replace the Files
Now you need to replace these files in your project:

**File locations:**
```
android/app/src/main/res/
├── mipmap-mdpi/
│   ├── ic_launcher.png      ← Replace with your 48x48 image
│   └── ic_launcher_round.png ← Replace with your 48x48 image (same image)
├── mipmap-hdpi/
│   ├── ic_launcher.png      ← Replace with your 72x72 image
│   └── ic_launcher_round.png ← Replace with your 72x72 image (same image)
├── mipmap-xhdpi/
│   ├── ic_launcher.png      ← Replace with your 96x96 image
│   └── ic_launcher_round.png ← Replace with your 96x96 image (same image)
├── mipmap-xxhdpi/
│   ├── ic_launcher.png      ← Replace with your 144x144 image
│   └── ic_launcher_round.png ← Replace with your 144x144 image (same image)
└── mipmap-xxxhdpi/
    ├── ic_launcher.png      ← Replace with your 192x192 image
    └── ic_launcher_round.png ← Replace with your 192x192 image (same image)
```

**How to replace:**
1. Navigate to each folder (mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-hdpi, etc.)
2. Right-click on ic_launcher.png → Delete
3. Copy your resized image into the folder
4. Rename it to "ic_launcher.png"
5. Copy the same image again and rename it to "ic_launcher_round.png"
6. Repeat for all 5 folders

### Step 4: Test Your Icon
1. Run: `npx react-native run-android`
2. Look at your phone/emulator
3. The app icon should now be your Whispr logo!

## 🚀 Even Easier Option
If this still seems complicated, just tell me:
1. What image editor do you have? (Paint, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Do you want me to walk you through it step by step?

I can guide you through each step personally!
