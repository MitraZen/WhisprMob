# Whispr App - Simplified Version

## Current Status

Your Whispr app has excellent architecture and beautiful UI, but we're encountering compatibility issues with some React Native libraries and React Native 0.81.4.

## Issues Encountered

1. **react-native-svg** - Compatibility issues with React Native 0.81.4
2. **react-native-screens** - Fabric/New Architecture compatibility issues
3. **Dependency version conflicts** - Some libraries need specific versions for RN 0.81.4

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use React Native 0.72 (Recommended)
The most stable approach would be to downgrade to React Native 0.72, which has better compatibility with the current ecosystem.

### Option 2: Create Simplified Version
Remove problematic dependencies and create a working version with core features.

### Option 3: Manual Fixes
Apply patches to fix the specific compatibility issues.

## Manual Steps to Try

If you want to try running it manually:

1. **Start Metro Bundler:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, try:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android --verbose
